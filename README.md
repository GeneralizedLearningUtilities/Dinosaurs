# Dinosaurs
Incomplete or archiac code that might have useful ideas or reasonable patterns to follow for future work.  No need to try to run this.

This directory contains ancient and extinct code that may contain useful things to extract at a later time.  Committing for first commits and then will remove this from the head of the repository.  For some of these, newer and improved versions exist in closed-source form that may be released at later times.  For others, they are working scratch-sheets for ideas, were the ideas might be useful but the specific code is not necessarily such.
